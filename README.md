# Week 1
- I was introduced to the subject DISMATH and I was also introduced to my classmates.
- I learned that DISMATH will only focus on mathematical truth.
- I find it very disappointing that scientific truth cannot be proven but it can only be disproved by an experiment.
- I learned the different logical operators.

Operator |Symbol
------ | --------
not  | ¬ 
and  | ∧ 
or  | ∨ 
xor  | ⊕
if,then  | →
iff  | ↔
- I learned how to use the truth table and I learned that it helps in understanding logical operators.

p   |   q   |   ∧    |   ∨   |   ⊕   |   →   |   ↔
------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------| --------| --------
F   |  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |  T  |  T
F   |  T  |  F  |  T  |  T  |  T  |  F
T   |  F  |  F  |  T  |  T  |  F  |  F
T   |  T  |  T  |  T  |  F  |  T  |  T
- I learned that the converse(q→p) and the inverse(¬p→¬q) of a conditional statement is not the same with the original statement(p→q).
- Only the contrapositive(¬q→¬p) is the same with the original statement.

# Week 2
- I learned the use of Logical equivalence and i realized that it is the same as simplyfying in algebra and proving in trigonometry.
- The following are the different logical equivalences that I've learned
  * Identity laws
  * Domination laws
  * Negation laws
  * Double negation law
  * Idempotent laws
  * Commutative laws
  * Associative laws
  * Distributive laws
  * De Morgan's laws
  * Absorption laws
- i learned the definition and use of Existential quantifier(∃x) and the Universal quantifier(∀x)
- Existential quantifier states **"there exist"** while Universal quantifier states **"for all"**
- To prove an existential statement ∃xP(x), only 1 example where x is true needed; to disprove it, every x must be false.
- To prove a universal statement ∀xP(x), every x must be true.; to disprove it, only 1 example where x is false needed.
- I learned that an argument is valid if it follows the pattern of the rules of inference.
- The different patterns of rules of inference are tautology which states that a statement is true for any value of the two variables p and q.
- The validity is different from the truth of an argument.
- The following are the different rules of inference that I've learned
  * Modus ponens
  * Modus tollens
  * Hypothetical syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  
# Week 3
- I learned how to prove statements using the different methods of proof.
- The following are the different methods of proof that I've learned
  * direct proof
  * proof by contraposition
  * vacuous and trivial proofs
- I learned how to create a repository in Github.
- I learned to use the different Markdowns in Github.
- I did not learn how to put two items in a single cell in a table markdown that's why i did not create a table for logical equivalence and rules of inference.
